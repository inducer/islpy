Installation
============

This command should install :mod:`islpy`::

    pip install islpy

For a more manual installation from source, `download the source
<http://pypi.org/project/islpy>`__, unpack it, and say::

	pip install -v .

You may also clone its git repository::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/inducer/islpy.git

The following attempts an editable installation, however note
that this may run into various issues and is not well-supported
by the build tools. In particular, build isolation must be turned off::

    pip install cmake scikit_build_core nanobind pcpp  # prerequisites
    pip install --no-build-isolation --config-settings=build-dir=build -ve .

Support
=======

You can try posting questions or comments at the
`Github Discussions site <https://github.com/inducer/islpy/discussions>`__
for islpy.

For a mailing list, please consider using the `isl list
<http://groups.google.com/group/isl-development>`_ until they tell us to get
lost.

.. note::

    * isl and imath, which islpy depends on, are also licensed under the `MIT
      license <http://repo.or.cz/w/isl.git/blob/HEAD:/LICENSE>`_.

    * GMP, which used to be a dependency of isl and thus islpy, is no longer
      required. (but building against it can optionally be requested)

Relation with isl's C interface
===============================

Nearly all of the bindings to isl are auto-generated, using the following
rules:

* Follow :pep:`8`.
* Expose the underlying object-oriented structure.
* Remove the `isl_` and `ISL_` prefixes from data types, macros and
  function names, replace them with Python namespaces.
* A method `isl_printer_print_set` would thus become
  :meth:`islpy.Printer.print_set`.

See also :ref:`gen-remarks`.

User-visible Changes
====================

Version 2016.2
--------------
.. note::

    This version is currently in development and can be obtained from
    islpy's version control.

* Update for isl 0.17
* Add :func:`islpy.make_zero_and_vars`

Version 2016.1.1
----------------

* Add :func:`islpy.make_zero_and_vars`
* Do not turn on small-integer optimization by default
  (to avoid build trouble on old compilers)

Version 2016.1
--------------

* Update for isl 0.16

Version 2014.2.1
----------------

* :mod:`islpy` now avoids using 2to3 for Python 3 compatibility.

Version 2014.2
--------------

* A large number of previously unavailable functions are now exposed.

* Sebastian Pop's `imath <https://github.com/creachadair/imath>`__ support has
  been merged into the version of isl that ships with :mod:`islpy`. This means
  that unless a user specifically requests a build against GMP, :mod:`islpy`
  is (a) entirely self-contained and depends only on a C++ compiler and
  (b) is entirely MIT-licensed by default.

Version 2014.1
--------------

* Many classes are now picklable.

* isl's handling of integer's has changed, forcing islpy to make
  incompatible changes as well.

  Now :class:`islpy.Val` is used to represent all numbers going
  into and out of :mod:`islpy`. ``gmpy`` is no longer a dependency
  of :mod:`islpy`. The following rules apply for this interface change:

  * You can pass (up to ``long int``-sized) integers to methods of
    isl objects without manual conversion to :class:`islpy.Val`.
    For larger numbers, you need to convert manually for now.

  * All numbers returned from :mod:`islpy` will be of type :class:`islpy.Val`.
    If they are integers, they can be converted

  * Since upstream made the decision to make ``isl_XXX_do_something_val``
    not always semantically equivalent to ``isl_XXX_do_something``, the
    old functions were removed.

    One example of this is ``isl_aff_get_constant``, which returned just
    the constant, and ``isl_aff_get_constant_val``, which returns the
    constant divided by the :class:`islpy.Aff`'s denominator as a rational
    value.

Version 2011.3
--------------

* Add :meth:`islpy.Set.project_out_except` and friends.
* Add ``islpy.Set.remove_divs_of_dim_type`` and friends.
* ``islpy.Dim`` was renamed to :class:`islpy.Space` in isl.
* ``islpy.Div`` was removed and replaced by :class:`islpy.Aff`
  wherever it was used previously.
* ``islpy.BasicSet.as_set`
  and
  ``islpy.BasicMap.as_map``
  were removed.
* :ref:`automatic-casts` were added.
* Support for more Python :class:`set`-like behavior was added. In particular,
  the operators `|`, `&', '-', `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=` work as expected.
* Support direct construction from string for objects that have a `read_from_str`
  method.
* The constant in a :class:`islpy.Constraint` is now set as the '1'
  key in a coefficient dictionary in
  :meth:`islpy.Constraint.eq_from_names`,
  :meth:`islpy.Constraint.ineq_from_names`, and
  :meth:`islpy.Constraint.set_coefficients_by_name`.

Version 2011.2
--------------

* Switch to copy-by-default semantics.
* A few changes in Python-side functionality.
* Automatic type promotion in 'self' argument.

Version 2011.1
--------------

* Initial release.
